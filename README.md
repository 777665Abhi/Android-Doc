## ‚úÖ **What is Android, and How Does it Work?**

---

### üì± **What is Android?**

**Android** is an **open-source** operating system developed by **Google**, primarily designed for **mobile devices** such as smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and even wearables.  

- It is based on the **Linux kernel**.  
- Written mainly in **Java, Kotlin, and C++**.  
- Android powers **billions of devices** around the world.  
- It supports a huge ecosystem of **apps via Google Play Store**.

---

### üß† **How Android Works (Architecture Overview)**

Android is structured in **layers**, where each layer interacts with the one above or below it:

#### 1. **Linux Kernel (Bottom Layer)**  
- Acts as a bridge between hardware and software.  
- Handles **low-level device operations**: memory management, security, drivers, etc.  

#### 2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**  
- Acts as an interface between the hardware and the higher Android system.  
- Converts function calls from higher layers to hardware-specific commands.

#### 3. **Android Runtime (ART)**  
- Replaces the older Dalvik VM.  
- Converts bytecode to native instructions using **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** and **Just-in-Time (JIT)** compilation.  
- Handles garbage collection and app execution.  

#### 4. **Native Libraries (C/C++)**  
- Includes core libraries like SQLite (database), WebKit (browser engine), OpenGL (graphics), etc.  
- These are used internally or via NDK (Native Development Kit).  

#### 5. **Java/Kotlin Libraries & Framework**  
- Provide essential APIs (Activity Manager, View System, Location, etc.)  
- Android app developers use these via Java or Kotlin.  

#### 6. **Application Framework**  
- High-level services that developers use, like:  
  - Activity Manager  
  - Notification Manager  
  - Resource Manager  
  - Content Providers  

#### 7. **Applications (Top Layer)**  
- These are the actual apps: Gmail, WhatsApp, Camera, etc.  
- Installed apps interact with the OS using SDK & APIs provided in the framework.

## What are the four main components of an Android application?

The **four main components** of an Android application are:

---

### üîπ 1. **Activity**

- Represents a **single screen with a user interface (UI)**.
- It‚Äôs where users **interact** with your app.
- Each activity goes through a **lifecycle** (e.g., `onCreate()`, `onPause()`).

üìå **Example:** Login screen, Home screen, Settings screen.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    }
}
```

---

### üîπ 2. **Service**

- A component that runs in the **background**, without a UI.
- Used for long-running operations (e.g., playing music, downloading files).
- Can be **foreground, background**, or **bound** service.

üìå **Example:** Music playing app service.

```kotlin
class MyService : Service() {
    override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {
        // Do background work
        return START_STICKY
    }
}
```

---

### üîπ 3. **Broadcast Receiver**

- Listens for **system-wide broadcast events** (e.g., battery low, airplane mode).
- Apps can also **send custom broadcasts**.
- It doesn‚Äôt display a UI, but can **trigger notifications** or start other components.

üìå **Example:** Listening for device boot.

```kotlin
class BootReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        if (intent.action == Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED) {
            // Start some service or task
        }
    }
}
```

---

### üîπ 4. **Content Provider**

- Manages **data sharing** between applications.
- Provides a **standard interface to query or modify** data.
- Typically used with **SQLite**, but can work with any data source.

üìå **Example:** Accessing contacts, media files, etc.

```kotlin
val cursor = contentResolver.query(
    ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI,
    null, null, null, null
)
```

---

### üß© Summary Table

| Component         | Purpose                          | Has UI? |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| **Activity**      | Represents a screen              | ‚úÖ Yes  |
| **Service**       | Background processing            | ‚ùå No   |
| **BroadcastReceiver** | Listens/responds to system events | ‚ùå No   |
| **ContentProvider**   | Shares app data with others       | ‚ùå No   |

---


### What is an Activity in Android?
In Android, an **Activity** is a **single, focused screen** that the user interacts with. Think of it like a window or a page in an app. Each Activity represents a **UI** (user interface) where users can do something‚Äîlike view a list, fill out a form, or play a video.

### Key Points:
- It‚Äôs a **core component** of Android apps.
- An app can have **multiple activities** (like LoginActivity, MainActivity, SettingsActivity, etc.).
- Activities are managed in a **back stack**, which allows users to navigate back through the app‚Äôs history.

### Example:
```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); // sets the layout for this activity
    }
}
```

### Activity Lifecycle:
Activities go through a lifecycle with methods like:
- `onCreate()`: Called when the activity is first created.
- `onStart()`: Called when the activity becomes visible.
- `onResume()`: Called when the activity starts interacting with the user.Sure! Here are one-line definitions for each:
- `onPause()`: Called when the activity is partially visible but no longer in the foreground (e.g., another activity is in front, but this one is still visible in the background).  
- `onStop()`: Called when the activity is completely hidden and no longer visible to the user.  
- `onDestroy()`: Called before the activity is destroyed, allowing final cleanup of resources.
  
- `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onDestroy()`: Called when the activity is going into the background or being destroyed.

### üîÅ **Multiple Activities Interaction Example**

Imagine you have two activities: `MainActivity` and `DetailsActivity`.

#### Flow:
1. User opens app ‚Üí `MainActivity` goes through `onCreate()` ‚Üí `onStart()` ‚Üí `onResume()`.
2. User taps on an item ‚Üí `DetailsActivity` starts:
   - `MainActivity`: `onPause()` ‚Üí `onStop()`  
   - `DetailsActivity`: `onCreate()` ‚Üí `onStart()` ‚Üí `onResume()`
3. User presses back:
   - `DetailsActivity`: `onPause()` ‚Üí `onStop()` ‚Üí `onDestroy()`  
   - `MainActivity`: `onRestart()` ‚Üí `onStart()` ‚Üí `onResume()`

---

### What is the difference between an Activity and a Fragment?

Great question! **Activity** and **Fragment** are both essential components in Android development, but they serve different purposes. Here's a clear breakdown:

---

### üß± **Activity vs Fragment**

| Feature         | **Activity**                                | **Fragment**                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | A screen with a UI that the user interacts with | A reusable portion of the UI inside an activity     |
| **Lifecycle**   | Independent lifecycle                       | Lifecycle is **dependent** on the host Activity     |
| **Usage**       | Typically used as a full screen / container | Used for modular UI (e.g., tabs, dynamic UIs)       |
| **Navigation**  | Navigated using Intents                    | Replaced/added using FragmentManager                |
| **UI Handling** | Directly handles UI                        | Needs to be attached to an Activity for UI          |
| **Reusability** | Less reusable                              | Highly reusable in multiple activities             |
| **Back Stack**  | Managed by Android system                  | Managed manually using FragmentManager              |

---

### What is an Intent, and how do you use it to navigate between activities?

An **Intent** in Android is a **messaging object** used to request an action from another component‚Äîlike starting an Activity, sending data, or starting a service.

---

### üß≠ **What is an Intent?**

- It's a way to **communicate between components**.
- Most commonly used to **navigate between activities** or to **send data** from one activity to another.

---

### üì¶ Types of Intents:
1. **Explicit Intent**: Specifies the exact component (e.g., `SecondActivity.class`).
2. **Implicit Intent**: Declares a general action to be performed (e.g., "view a web page").

---

### üöÄ **Navigating Between Activities (Explicit Intent)**

#### **Example**: Going from `MainActivity` to `SecondActivity`

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);
```

---

### üì® **Passing Data Between Activities**

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);
intent.putExtra("username", "JohnDoe");
startActivity(intent);
```

#### In `SecondActivity`:
```java
String username = getIntent().getStringExtra("username");
```

---

### üîô Go Back to Previous Activity

- Just use the **Back button**, or call:
```java
finish(); // This closes the current activity and returns to the previous one
```

---


### What is the purpose of the AndroidManifest.xml file?

The **`AndroidManifest.xml`** file is like the **blueprint** of your Android app. It tells the Android system everything it needs to know about your app **before it runs**.

---

### üßæ **Purpose of `AndroidManifest.xml`:**

1. **Declare components**  
   - All **Activities**, **Services**, **BroadcastReceivers**, and **ContentProviders** must be declared here.
   ```xml
   <activity android:name=".MainActivity" />
   ```

2. **Request permissions**  
   - If your app needs access to the internet, camera, storage, etc.
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   ```

3. **Define app metadata**  
   - Like app name, icon, theme, minimum SDK version, etc.
   ```xml
   <application
       android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
       android:label="@string/app_name">
   ```

4. **Set the launcher activity**  
   - The entry point when the app starts.
   ```xml
   <intent-filter>
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
   </intent-filter>
   ```

5. **Declare hardware and software features**
   - E.g., touchscreen, camera, sensors, etc.


The `AndroidManifest.xml` acts as a **bridge between your app and the Android OS**, ensuring the system knows **what your app needs**, **what it contains**, and **how to launch it**.


---
### What is the role of Gradle in an Android project?

Great question! **Gradle** is the **build system** used in Android development. It‚Äôs like the behind-the-scenes **automation engine** that compiles your code, packages it into APKs, manages dependencies, and more.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Role of Gradle in Android Projects:**

1. **Build Automation**  
   - Compiles your Java/Kotlin code.
   - Merges resources (XML, images, etc.).
   - Generates APKs or AABs for different build variants (like `debug` and `release`).

2. **Dependency Management**  
   - Automatically downloads and includes libraries from repositories like Maven or JCenter.
   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
   ```

3. **Build Variants and Flavors**  
   - You can define different versions of your app (e.g., free vs paid, dev vs prod).
   ```groovy
   buildTypes {
       debug {
           // debug-specific config
       }
       release {
           minifyEnabled true
           proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt')
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Custom Tasks & Scripts**  
   - You can write custom Gradle tasks to automate stuff like versioning, code generation, signing, etc.

5. **Integration with Android Studio**  
   - Android Studio uses Gradle under the hood, so when you click **Run**, it‚Äôs Gradle doing the actual work.

---

### üìÅ Key Gradle Files in Android:
- `build.gradle (Project-level)` ‚Äì Configures global settings, repositories, plugin versions.
- `build.gradle (App/module-level)` ‚Äì Configures the app itself: dependencies, build types, SDK versions, etc.
- `gradle-wrapper.properties` ‚Äì Defines the version of Gradle to use.

---
**Gradle = The engine that builds, packages, and manages everything in your Android project.**

---

### How do you run an Android application on a real device?
Running your Android app on a **real device** is super useful for testing performance and hardware-related features. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to get it up and running:

---

### üì≤ **Steps to Run Your App on a Real Android Device:**

#### ‚úÖ **1. Enable Developer Options on the Device**
- Go to **Settings** > **About phone**.
- Tap **Build number** 7 times until you see *"You are now a developer!"*.

#### ‚úÖ **2. Enable USB Debugging**
- Go to **Settings** > **System** > **Developer options**.
- Turn on **USB Debugging**.

#### ‚úÖ **3. Connect Device via USB**
- Plug your phone into your computer using a USB cable.
- Select **‚ÄúFile Transfer‚Äù (MTP)** or **‚ÄúUSB Debugging‚Äù** mode when prompted on your device.

#### ‚úÖ **4. Authorize the Connection**
- You‚Äôll see a prompt on your phone:  
  > *Allow USB debugging?*  
  Tap **Allow**.

#### ‚úÖ **5. Run from Android Studio**
- Open your project in **Android Studio**.
- Click the **Run (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) button**.
- In the **device chooser**, select your connected device.

---

### üß™ Tip:
If your device doesn‚Äôt show up:
- Make sure **USB drivers** are installed (especially on Windows).
- Try `adb devices` in terminal to check if it's detected.

---

### üîÅ Optional: Wireless Debugging (Android 11+)
You can also connect your device **wirelessly** via Wi-Fi using ADB over network.

---
### What is an XML layout file in Android?

An **XML layout file** in Android defines the **user interface (UI)** of an app screen using **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**. It's how you describe **what the screen should look like** ‚Äî buttons, text, images, and how they are arranged.

---

### üßæ **What is it used for?**
- Describes the **structure and appearance** of the UI.
- Used by Activities and Fragments to **inflate (load)** the UI.
- Makes it easy to **separate design from code**.

---

### üîß **Basic Example: `activity_main.xml`**
```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/helloText"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Hello World!" />

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/myButton"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Click me" />

</LinearLayout>
```

---

### üîÅ How it's used in code:
In your `Activity`:
```java
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); // Loads the XML layout
```

You can then access UI elements like:
```java
Button myButton = findViewById(R.id.myButton);
```

---

An XML layout file is where you **design the screen** ‚Äî what users see and interact with ‚Äî using a clean, declarative format.

---

### What are the different types of layouts available in Android?

In Android, **layouts** are containers that define **how UI elements (Views)** are arranged on the screen. Android provides several built-in layout types to suit different design needs.

---

### üß± **Common Types of Layouts in Android:**

| Layout Type          | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **LinearLayout**     | Arranges children in a **single row or column** (vertically or horizontally). |
| **RelativeLayout**   | Positions children **relative to each other or to the parent**. |
| **ConstraintLayout** | A powerful and flexible layout that allows you to create **complex UIs with flat view hierarchies** using constraints. |
| **FrameLayout**      | Displays a **single child** view or **stacks views** on top of each other. Great for fragments or overlays. |
| **TableLayout**      | Arranges children into **rows and columns**, like a table. |
| **GridLayout**       | Places views in a **grid-like structure** (rows + columns), more flexible than TableLayout. |
| **CoordinatorLayout**| A super-powered FrameLayout for implementing **material design interactions** like collapsing toolbars and floating action buttons. |
| **ScrollView**       | A layout that provides **scrolling** for its content (vertically). |

---
- Prefer **ConstraintLayout** for complex UIs ‚Äî it avoids deep nesting and improves performance.
- Use **ScrollView** when content might not fit the screen.
- Avoid deeply nested layouts for better performance.

---

### Want a visual diagram of each layout or help choosing the best one for your screen design?


Here are answers to your Android-related questions:

---

### 1. **What is the difference between LinearLayout and RelativeLayout?**

| **Feature**       | **LinearLayout**                                  | **RelativeLayout**                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | Arranges child views in **a single row or column** (vertical or horizontal). | Positions child views **relative to each other** or **to the parent container**. |
| **Usage**         | Simple layouts with a clear sequence of elements. | More flexible for complex layouts.             |
| **Performance**   | Faster as it is simpler to compute.              | Slightly slower due to measuring relative positions. |
| **Example**       | Displaying a list of items in a vertical or horizontal order. | Aligning elements like a button below a TextView. |

---

### 2. **How do you display a simple TextView and Button in an Android app?**

**`activity_main.xml`** (UI Layout):
```xml
<LinearLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/textView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Hello, World!" />

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Click Me" />
</LinearLayout>
```

**`MainActivity.java`**:
```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); // Load the XML layout
    }
}
```

---

### 3. **What is the purpose of `findViewById()`?**

- **Definition**: `findViewById()` is used to **retrieve a reference to a UI element** (like a `TextView`, `Button`, etc.) defined in an XML layout file.
- **Purpose**: It allows you to interact with the UI element in Java/Kotlin code (e.g., set text, handle clicks).
- **Example**:
    ```java
    TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.textView);
    textView.setText("New Text");
    ```

---

### 4. **How do you handle button clicks in Android?**

You can handle button clicks in two common ways:

#### ** Using an `OnClickListener`:**
```java
Button button = findViewById(R.id.button);
button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        // Handle button click
        Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Button clicked!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
});
```

#### ** Using `onClick` Attribute in XML:**
**XML**:
```xml
<Button
    android:id="@+id/button"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:onClick="handleButtonClick"
    android:text="Click Me" />
```

**Java**:
```java
public void handleButtonClick(View view) {
    Toast.makeText(this, "Button clicked!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
```

---

###  **What is a RecyclerView, and how is it different from ListView?**

| **Feature**         | **RecyclerView**                                   | **ListView**                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | A flexible and efficient version of ListView.     | A simpler component for displaying a list of items. |
| **Performance**     | Reuses views via the **ViewHolder pattern** for better performance. | Less efficient as it does not reuse views properly. |
| **Flexibility**     | Highly customizable with support for grids, staggered layouts, etc. | Limited to simple vertical lists.               |
| **Animation**       | Supports item animations out of the box.          | Requires additional coding for animations.      |
| **Adapter**         | Uses `RecyclerView.Adapter`.                      | Uses `ArrayAdapter` or similar.                 |

---

###  **How do you change the theme or color scheme of an Android app?**

#### **Steps to Change Theme/Colors:**
1. **Edit `res/values/themes.xml`:**
   ```xml
   <style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.Material3.DayNight">
       <item name="colorPrimary">@color/primary</item>
       <item name="colorPrimaryVariant">@color/primary_variant</item>
       <item name="colorSecondary">@color/secondary</item>
   </style>
   ```
   - Replace colors with your custom ones in `res/values/colors.xml`.

2. **Apply the Theme in `AndroidManifest.xml`:**
   ```xml
   <application
       android:theme="@style/Theme.MyApp">
   ```

3. **Use `AppCompat`/Material Design Components** to respect the theme.

###  **What is an explicit intent vs. an implicit intent?**

| **Type**        | **Explicit Intent**                              | **Implicit Intent**                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**   | Specifies the exact component (Activity/Service) to be opened. | Declares an action or task to be handled by any matching app. |
| **Use Case**     | Navigation within your app, e.g., opening another activity. | Opening external apps, e.g., opening a web page. |
| **Example**      | ```java
Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);
startActivity(intent); 
``` | ```java
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("https://www.example.com"));
startActivity(intent);
``` |

---

### 8. **How do you pass data between activities using Intent?**

#### **Passing Data:**
**In `MainActivity`:**
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);
intent.putExtra("username", "JohnDoe");
startActivity(intent);
```

#### **Receiving Data:**
**In `SecondActivity`:**
```java
String username = getIntent().getStringExtra("username");
```

---

### **What is the back stack in Android?**

- The **back stack** is a **stack data structure** used to manage the order of activities in an Android app.
- **Purpose**: It allows users to navigate through activities using the **Back button**.
- When an activity is started, it is **pushed onto the stack**. When the Back button is pressed, the current activity is **popped off the stack**, and the previous activity is resumed.

#### **Example:**
1. Open `Activity A` ‚Üí `Activity B` ‚Üí `Activity C`.
2. Back button pressed ‚Üí `Activity C` is removed, and `Activity B` is displayed.

--- 


###  **How do you open a new activity using an Intent?**

To open a new activity, you use an **explicit intent** to specify the target activity.

#### Example:
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(CurrentActivity.this, NewActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);
```

- **`CurrentActivity.this`**: The context of the current activity.
- **`NewActivity.class`**: The activity you want to open.

---

###  **What is the purpose of `startActivityForResult()`?**

- **Purpose**: `startActivityForResult()` is used to **start another activity** and then **receive a result back** from that activity.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used for scenarios like picking an image from the gallery, taking a photo, or getting user input.

#### Example:
**In Caller Activity**:
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(CurrentActivity.this, NewActivity.class);
startActivityForResult(intent, 1); // 1 is the request code
```

**In Called Activity**:
```java
Intent resultIntent = new Intent();
resultIntent.putExtra("data_key", "Result Data");
setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, resultIntent);
finish(); // Finish the activity and return the result
```

**Handling the Result in Caller Activity**:
```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if (requestCode == 1 && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
        String result = data.getStringExtra("data_key");
        // Use the result
    }
}
```

---

###  **What are SharedPreferences in Android?**

**SharedPreferences** is a lightweight storage option for storing **key-value pairs**. It is primarily used for **storing small amounts of data**, such as user preferences, settings, or flags.

#### Features:
- Stores **primitive data types**: `String`, `int`, `float`, `boolean`, `long`.
- Data persists even after the app is closed.

---

###  **How do you store and retrieve a simple key-value pair using SharedPreferences?**

#### Storing Data:
```java
SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences("MyPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
editor.putString("username", "JohnDoe"); // Key: "username", Value: "JohnDoe"
editor.apply(); // Save changes
```

#### Retrieving Data:
```java
SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences("MyPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
String username = sharedPreferences.getString("username", "DefaultName"); // DefaultName if key doesn't exist
```

---

###  **What is the difference between Internal Storage and External Storage in Android?**

| **Feature**          | **Internal Storage**                               | **External Storage**                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Storage space that is **private** to the app.     | Storage space that is **accessible** by other apps and users. |
| **Accessibility**     | Data is not accessible by other apps.             | Data can be accessed by other apps (with permissions). |
| **Security**          | More secure; files are app-private.               | Less secure as it can be accessed openly.       |
| **Use Case**          | Storing sensitive or app-only data.               | Sharing files like images, videos, or documents. |
| **Example Path**      | `/data/data/<app_package>/files/`                 | `/storage/emulated/0/` or `/sdcard/`            |

###  **How does SQLite work in Android?**

- **SQLite** is a lightweight, embedded, relational database engine included in Android.
- It allows you to perform SQL operations (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`) to manage structured data.

#### Steps to Use SQLite:
1. **Create a Database**:
   ```java
   SQLiteDatabase db = openOrCreateDatabase("MyDatabase", Context.MODE_PRIVATE, null);
   db.execSQL("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER);");
   ```

2. **Insert Data**:
   ```java
   db.execSQL("INSERT INTO Users (name, age) VALUES ('John', 30);");
   ```

3. **Retrieve Data**:
   ```java
   Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM Users", null);
   if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {
       do {
           int id = cursor.getInt(0);
           String name = cursor.getString(1);
           int age = cursor.getInt(2);
       } while (cursor.moveToNext());
   }
   cursor.close();
   ```

---

###  **What is the Room database, and why is it recommended over SQLite?**

**Room** is a **Jetpack library** that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite for easier database access and management.

#### Advantages of Room Over SQLite:
1. **Compile-Time Verification**: SQL queries are verified at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
2. **Boilerplate Reduction**: Automatically handles table creation, updates, and common database operations.
3. **Integration with LiveData and Coroutines**: Supports modern Android architecture patterns.
4. **Migration Support**: Provides simpler tools for database versioning and migration.

#### Example Usage:
1. **Define an Entity**:
   ```java
   @Entity
   public class User {
       @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
       public int id;
       public String name;
       public int age;
   }
   ```

2. **Create a DAO (Data Access Object)**:
   ```java
   @Dao
   public interface UserDao {
       @Insert
       void insert(User user);

       @Query("SELECT * FROM User")
       List<User> getAllUsers();
   }
   ```

3. **Build the Database**:
   ```java
   @Database(entities = {User.class}, version = 1)
   public abstract class AppDatabase extends RoomDatabase {
       public abstract UserDao userDao();
   }

   AppDatabase db = Room.databaseBuilder(getApplicationContext(),
           AppDatabase.class, "MyDatabase").build();
   ```

Room is recommended for its ease of use, safety features, and integration with modern Android practices.

5. Networking
###  **What is an API, and how do you call an API in Android?**

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules and protocols that allow two software components to communicate with each other. For example, a weather app can use an API to fetch weather data from a server.
- **Calling an API in Android**:
  1. Use a library like **Retrofit** or **OkHttp** for network requests.
  2. Configure the API endpoint and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
  3. Parse the server's response (usually in JSON format) and display it in the app.

**Example using Retrofit:**
```java
public interface ApiService {
    @GET("users/{id}")
    Call<User> getUser(@Path("id") int userId);
}

// Create Retrofit instance
Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://api.example.com/")
    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
    .build();

// Call the API
ApiService apiService = retrofit.create(ApiService.class);
apiService.getUser(1).enqueue(new Callback<User>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Call<User> call, Response<User> response) {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            User user = response.body();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Call<User> call, Throwable t) {
        t.printStackTrace();
    }
});
```

---

###  **What is Retrofit, and why is it commonly used for network calls?**

- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, developed by Square. It simplifies API calls by abstracting HTTP requests and responses.
- **Why Retrofit?**
  1. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies making HTTP calls, such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.
  2. **Automatic Parsing**: Converts JSON responses into Java/Kotlin objects using converters (e.g., Gson, Moshi).
  3. **Error Handling**: Provides built-in mechanisms to handle API errors.
  4. **Scalability**: Easily supports complex APIs with query parameters, headers, and request bodies.

---

###  **How do you make an HTTP request in Android?**

There are several ways to make an HTTP request in Android:

#### **1. Using OkHttp:**
```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .url("https://api.example.com/data")
    .build();

client.newCall(request).enqueue(new Callback() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Call call, Response response) throws IOException {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            String responseData = response.body().string();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Call call, IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
});
```

#### ** Using HttpURLConnection (Native Approach):**
```java
URL url = new URL("https://api.example.com/data");
HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
connection.setRequestMethod("GET");

InputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
String line;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
    result.append(line);
}
reader.close();
```

---

###  **What is the purpose of JSON in API communication?**

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- **Purpose in API Communication**:
  1. **Data Serialization**: JSON is used to send and receive structured data (e.g., user details, lists) between the client (Android app) and server.
  2. **Interoperability**: JSON is language-independent, making it widely used across different platforms.
  3. **Readable Format**: Easy to debug and understand during development.

**Example JSON Response:**
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

---

### **What is OkHttp, and how does it help in networking?**

- **OkHttp**: A powerful HTTP client for Android and Java, developed by Square.
- **How it Helps in Networking**:
  1. **Efficient Connection Management**: Supports connection pooling, reducing network latency.
  2. **Interceptors**: Allows adding, modifying, or logging requests and responses.
  3. **Asynchronous Requests**: Supports both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP calls.
  4. **Caching**: Provides a built-in caching mechanism for offline support.
  5. **HTTP/2 Support**: Reduces network overhead and improves performance.

**Example with Interceptor:**
```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(chain -> {
        Request request = chain.request();
        Response response = chain.proceed(request);
        return response;
    })
    .build();
```
